    "description": "Welcome to Lancaster University Futsal Club! For those of you who don't already know, futsal is probably best described as indoor football with more rules. It is 5 a side, the ball is smaller and slightly weighted, and whilst there is a place for all the skills you see in montages on facebook, the game is more about tactics and fitness. The sport is rapidly growing in both the UK and at Lancaster University.\n\nIt was only introduced into the Roses competition with York in 2015. In the 18/19 season, we had one of our most successful years ever, winning the league and beating York at Roses for 4 points and our first win for the club in this tournament. Our first year back post covid proved to be succesful, we finished 2nd in the league. However, we want to push on now and with a very ambitious squad full of quality, our intention is to bring the league home. We are going to be having trials in October to recruit new team members. Check out our Facebook and Instagram pages to find out more, and hopefully for those who don’t make the team, there will be a casual futsal session once a week."

Our purpose is to give veggies and non-veggies alike opportunities to socialise, eat good food and have a great time, and sometimes even learn some new skills from cooking demos to activism.\n\nWe host weekly events including potlucks on campus where members bring veg food they've bought or made for us all to share and enjoy. Join our facebook group and you'll be invited to each one! We also love our meals out at veg-friendly restaurants in Lancaster. If your more interested in learning more about the vegan and vegetarian lifestyle, we do invite **guest speakers** to attend the university for talks and organise several **film and documentary showings** throughout the term to show you the wonderful positive differences you can make simply by changing what you eat. We also organise visits to **V****egan/Vegetarian festivals** in the North, where we get to meet like-minded people and empty our wallets on food, apparel and gifts of every kind - all cruelty-free and every penny going towards veg-friendly causes!\n\nWe are a very relaxed, friendly society with a wonderfully diverse range of members from all walks of life, so you're sure to find a friend or two (or more hopefully!) here! Our main aim is to create a community of like-minded people :) We look forward to seeing you at our next event!\n\n\\[_Follow us on instagram_: @luvegsoc and find us on Facebook by searching Lancaster University vegetarian and vegan society\\]"

    "description": "Welcome to Lancaster Lynx Rugby League.\n=======================================\n\nHere you will be able to keep up-to-date with training session times, social events and live match reports from our Facebook and Instagram pages.\n\nWe go into the 2023-24 season looking to build on a good performance last year, with aspirations of winning the league and cup. We also have a Roses win record of 100%, one of few clubs at the university to hold such a record. This university year, make the wise choice by joining Lancaster Lynx. Come find us at Freshers Fest. Don’t believe it, Rugby League it!\n\n**Training Times:**\n\n*   **Monday 4-5:30pm on the 3G**\n    \n*   **Sunday 6-7:30pm on the 3G**\n    \n*   **Wednesday Afternoon Matches/ Training if it is a by-week**\n    \n*   **Weekly socials every Wednesday**\n    \n\n**ROSES RECORD**\n\n**2007: Lancaster 70-4 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**2015: Lancaster 24-14 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**2016: Lancaster 56-10 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**2017: Lancaster 36-10 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**2018: Lancaster 64-20 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**2019: Lancaster 24-10 York (Lancaster WIN)**\n\n**100% Winning record for Lancaster**\n\nOur Victorious Roses Squad 2019\n-------------------------------\n\nOver the next year, you'll hear a lot of other societies tell you why they're better than other societies. So this is where we tell you why you should join us:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Great Sport**\\- Rugby league is a fast, furious and skilful sport that emphasises the tries and intense defence that make it such a great spectator and participant sport. Here at Lancaster, we have a proud 50-year history of playing rugby league, culminating in our unbeaten Roses record.\n\n*   **No previous experience required-** The great thing about Rugby League is it's easy to pick up. Many players come to us with little/no Rugby League experience and in some cases no Rugby experience at all. Regardless of experience, you're welcome to the club and hopefully you'll catch the Rugby League bug. In the past we have had experienced rugby league players, rugby union players, american footballers, hockey players and people who have never played sport before all join the club and play Roses for us.\n\n*   **We get the mix right-** We understand that primarily you're here to get a degree and we respect that. If you can't play/train because of upcoming deadlines or exams, we ask nothing more than you let us know in advance so we can plan around it. The Lynx family also extends off the pitch with senior and ex players offering guidance and support for other members, especially freshers.  \n\n*   **Old boys-** The highlight of the year for many of the current or old boys, and the envy of every toher society at uni, is our annual Old Boys event. We're very lucky to have great support from our Old Boys with players from as far back as the 60's keeping in check throughout the year and remaining active in the team. The Lynx being the second oldest club at the university boasts nearly 50 years of history with a long list of achievements including multiple cup and league titles, with players going onto represent regional students, England & GB students and even full international caps.\n\n*   **Great Socials-** Sugarhouse DJ, Jack Sprigg, openly said we had the 'Best theme for a social' (our annual Phoenix Nights social). We have an official social every Wednesday but frequently organise meet-ups which tend to take place in Fylde Bar. Team breakfasts also take place throughout the year before games and at the beginning of each term. This is a great way to get to know the rest of the team and helps you make friends for life.                                                                                                     \n\nExec 2023/24:\n\nChairman: Tom Headridge\n\nVice Chairman: Harry Woodworth\n\nCaptain: David Burgess\n\nVice Captain: Kyle Bailey\n\nSocial Sec: Dom Harrop & Charles Rudman\n\nSquirrel (Social Sec): Adam Bird\n\nMedia & Comms: Josh Jenkins\n\nHealth and Safety: Kyle Bailey\n\nWelfare Sec: Mike Bould\n\nTreasurer: Ollie Usher\n\nKit Sec: Emmanuel Madaku Agbeze\n\nWe're active on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram, please give us a follow!\n\nFacebook: Lancster Uni Rugby League 2023/24\n\nTwitter: @LancsUniRLFC\n\nInstagram: LancasterLynx\n\nSnapchat: LancasterLynx"

Our society works to support this campaign by hosting various fundraising events.

We also offer several volunteering opportunities including the Bay Dementia Hub, Defying Dementia Charity Shop, Join Dementia Research (JDR), and the chance to volunteer within the Dementia ward at Lancaster hospital.

    "description": "### Hi there!\n\nWe're the Lancaster University Manga and Anime Society (often referred to as LUMAS), and we are a group with an interest in Japanese animation and manga, and act as a forum to bring together other fans, whether they be very new to anime or have had years of experience or anything in between. We screen a wide variety of different animated shows, including things fresh from the new season and older shows even non-anime fans may have heard of at our meetings. We aim to host three events a week, including watch sessions and socials!\n\n* * *\n\n### **Where and When?**\n\nEvery _Wednesday_, we meet from **2pm-5pm in Furness LT1**, and watch a variety of different anime based on a particular theme (such as _Seinen, Romance_, Comedy, _Seasonals_, etc.). Over the past year, we have been conducting sessions with more broadly applicable themes, in an attempt to further improve the variety that this session brings to our members! These sessions in particular are extremely popular, and allow for a lot of discussion amongst the other members.\n\n\\---\n\nEvery _Saturday_, we meet from **2pm-5pm in Elizabeth Livingston Lecture Hall** and we watch a full show all the way through, voted on by the membership towards the start of the term. We usually juggle two shows concurrently, and we watch them over the course of around 4 weeks (but don't worry about missing one! We let you know exactly how far we get in each show every week, so it's easier to catch up with!). For Academic 2022/2023, we watched a number of highly-rated and well-regarded TV anime and films, including Vinland Saga, Black Lagoon, Samurai Champloo, Grand blue, Hinamatsuri! \n\n\\---\n\nEvery other _Monday_, we meet from **7:30pm-9:30pm in Bowland North Seminar 6**, for a more actively creative type of session which we call _Manga Mondays_! We have our large manga library available for members to lend books such as _One Piece, Jujustu Kaisen_ and _Attack On Titan_! In addition, we usually have a creative activity to do during these sessions that vary from week to week. In the past we have done scavenger hunt, quizzes, origami, and more! These sessions are great opportunity to get to know the other society members, and many current members consider these their most anticipated sessions! We generally hold a number of more competitive creative challenges throughout the course of the term during these sessions, and prizes in the past!\n\n\\---\n\nAdditionally, we hold a number of one-off events every year. In the past, these have included karaoke nights, film viewings (both on and off campus for movies such as Akira, A girl who leaped through time, _Redline, Perfect Blue,_ etc), karaoke, barbecues, bar crawls, scavenger hunt and more! These socials occur every other week (alternating with Manga Mondays), so make sure you are a member so that you can recieve our weekly emails that let you know which events are happening during that week. Also included in the email is a weekly submission, created each week by one of our members, so if you're looking for reccommendations, artwork or bad LUMAS memes there's no better place to start than there!\n\n\\---\n\nWith anime culture gaining more and more traction by the day with mainstream titles like _Chainsaw Man, Demon Slayer_ and _Attack on Titan_ coming out more and more frequently, it's never been a better time to get in on the action! Membership is only £5.00 for the entire academic year (23/24), and becoming a member grants you access to all of our socials and our entire ever-expanding manga library. You can also get a free Temporary Membership, which will give you the same privileges as a Full Membership but will only last until start of Week 4.\n\n* * *\n\n### Find us on social media!\n\n![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/360348/original/lumachan.png)\n\n*   [Discord](https://discord.gg/KKtMpNAUbP)\n    \n*   [Instagram](https://instagram.com/luanimesociety?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)\n    \n*   [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/LUMASAnime)\n    \n*   [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Luma_Chan_)\n    \n*   [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/LUMAS/animelist)"

    "description": "**_Wing Chun Society_**\n\nA society dedicated to Wing Chun Kung Fu, a Chinese martial art\n\n**Free Taster Session on the 10th of October 2023 at George Fox Foyer from 8pm-10pm, looking forward to meeting you!**\n\n_Training sessions._\n\n_\\- Tuesday 8pm-10pm at George Fox Foyer. (Instructor-Led)_\n\n_\\- Sunday 3pm-4pm at LGF Foyer, Library. (Student-Led)_\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/luwingchun/)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lancasterwingchun/)\n\n**_What is Wing Chun?_**\n\nWing Chun is a style of southern Chinese martial arts. It relies on scientific principles and experimentation in order to train, with the goal of learning effective self-defence. It is a striking art, with a focus on control and close-combat.\n\nOne of our core principles as a martial art is fighting in the most efficient way possible, while still staying safe; the process of experimentation we use allows us to do this, and lets people tailor their style to what works best for them.\n\n**_I’m smaller/weaker than average, can I still learn?_**\n\nSince Wing Chun was originally invented and tailored by a woman, the martial art is designed specifically with smaller people in mind. While it can still be learnt and practiced by taller people, they are not necessarily at an automatic advantage as they might be in other martial arts.\n\nWing Chun also uses a more relaxed style of fighting, so while strength can be useful, the martial art focuses on taking advantage of speed and dexterity over brute force.\n\n**_Do you have Weapons training?_**\n\nWing Chun traditionally makes use of two weapons, the Butterfly Swords and the Longpole.\n\nWhile we do not yet have any equipment for weapons training, we are hoping to purchase some this coming year, so it is likely we will be introducing training for Butterfly Swords. Since Wing Chun is focused on self-defence, and weapons build upon unarmed combat, they are usually only taught at a higher level.\n\n**_How much does it cost?_**\n\nYour first session at the society is free. After this, the training sessions cost £3 a week or £20 per term.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please ask.\n\n  \n**_Anything else I should know before joining?_**\n\nIf you can, you should wear loose clothing, and bring some drinking water with you.\n\nFor more up to date news, please visit our Facebook page:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1657967527754921/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1657967527754921/)\n\nOr our Instagram page:\n\n [https://www.instagram.com/lancasterwingchun/](https://www.instagram.com/lancasterwingchun/)"

Our society is NOT exclusive to those studying Criminology :)\n\nOur previous events include Murder Mystery Nights, Themed Pub Crawls, Escape Rooms, Pub Quizzes, Bingo, Movie Nights and many more! We offer a range of both drinking and non-drinking socials to accommodate for all students and vary the days that we hold events on to cater for students wanting to join or attend more than one society.\n\nThis year, we have merged with LU True Crime Society (@lutruecrime) to create a bigger and better society, open to all those with a love for true crime and criminology. Our regular CrimSoc social events will be held alongside new true crime case discussion and unsolved mystery evenings - doubling the number of events available to our members. Our membership price has slightly increased to reflect this.\n\nAt the end of Lent term, we hold our annual Criminology Ball, attended by students and Criminology/Law School lecturers. A night of dancing, fine dining and mingling, Crim Ball is the perfect way to end the term and relax with friends before exam season begins. \n\nMake sure to follow us on Instagram and Facebook to keep up to date with events coming up in 2023/24!\n\nJoin our 23/24 WhatsApp Chat: **[https://chat.whatsapp.com/EoifBEtPutt1zOsaPsltzA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EoifBEtPutt1zOsaPsltzA)** \n\nInstagram: [**https://www.instagram.com/lucrimsoc/**](https://www.instagram.com/lucrimsoc/ \"https://www.instagram.com/lucrimsoc/\")\n\nFacebook: [**Lancaster Criminology Society | Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/Lancscrimsoc \"https://www.facebook.com/Lancscrimsoc\")\n\nFor more information, email us at: [criminology.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:criminology.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk \"mailto:criminology.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk\")"

    "description": "Underwater Hockey (UWH) is a limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team's goal. Whilst it was found in England in the 1950s, it is now popular all over the world, especially in countries like Austrailia, New Zealand, and Canada!\n\nWe are a friendly team who play competitively and for fun. We welcome everyone of all abilities, from complete beginners to seasoned professionals, you're sure to enjoy being part of our society! Most of our members have never played before, some haven't even heard of the sport, but once you try it you won't want to give it up. We play and compete as a mixed sex team. A gym membership is not needed.\n\nAs well as regular training sessions we hold a variety of socials. As the game is based underwater it's hard to socialise with the team in training, so we make an effort to get together above water and often hold socials ranging from nights out, team meals, trips, and chilled nights in.\n\nCome and give it a go... you won't regret it!\n\n![Roses 2017](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/131275/optimized/IMG_6001.JPG)![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/154267/optimized/IMG_2465.jpg)![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/424365/original/Capture_4.PNG)\n\n                 Roses 2017                                    Nationals 2018                               Roses 2019\n\n![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/424362/original/Capture_2.PNG)![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/424363/original/Capture_3.PNG)![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/424358/original/Capture.PNG)\n\n           Christmas Meal 2021                        Roses 2022                              Nationals 2022\n\nFacebook: [LUUnderwaterHockey](https://www.facebook.com/LUUnderwaterHockey) \n\nTwitter: [@LU\\_Water\\_Hockey](https://twitter.com/lu_water_hockey) \n\nInstagram: [lu\\_underwaterhockey](https://www.instagram.com/lu_underwaterhockey) \n\n(Old Account: [lu\\_underwater\\_hockey](https://www.instagram.com/lu_underwater_hockey) )\n\nOutlook: underwaterhockey.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk\n\nAt present our training times are as follows:\n\nMondays: Fitness 19:30-20:30 Fylde LT2\n\nWEDNESDAYS: 15:00-16:00 - Sports Centre Pool"

We are a Students Union Subcommittee who operate a Forum, not a society – we do not have a membership list nor do we charge a fee of any kind.\n\nThe LGBTQ+ Forum exists to promote LGBTQ+ equality within the student community and, where possible, on a wider scale. We strive to make all of our events and meetings ‘safe spaces’ – this means that they are completely confidential, and we never publicise who attends without asking their permission. Respecting that safe space is our highest priority, as we want to ensure anyone coming into a meeting feels comfortable there.\n\nWe have weekly Monday coffee evenings where you can chat with new people over a cup of tea or coffee. We also run regular socials, campaigns, and other events. We’d love to see you at any of our meetings or events, so you’re always welcome to come along!\n\nFor all of our social media and links look at our current links page [**here**](https://lancastersu.co.uk/groups/lgbtq-forum/pages/current-links).  \nWe also have a discord server which we use as a group chat and to advertise events for the forum.

In the society, we prefer not to follow any one particular style, instead absorbing techniques from Karate, Taekwondo, Dutch and Thai styles in order to create a perfect blend for competitive success. Come to one or all of our 3  weekly taught sessions to develop new skills, enjoy a friendly atmosphere, a satisfying workout, and become a badass along the way. Want to do your own thing, use the equipment or spar with a buddy? We have weekend open-mat sessions you can come along to and train for a fouth time in the week.\n\n**Beginner?**\n\nWe cater to all ability levels and people of all martial arts backgrounds, so do not hesitate to join us for a session.  During Michelmas term we have weekly sessions that are especially for beginners who may have never done any contact sport before or help people with experience in another martial art transfer their skills to Kickboxing.

We offer comprehensive training which allows you to start with no experience and provide a safe environment with crash mats and soft blocks allowing members to progress quickly and safely. LUPATS promotes a friendly atmosphere where members support each other and happily provide tips and advice when you are learning new skills. The society has always thrived as a close community that shares experiences such as our annual Easter trip to a European city that result in great friendships and lasting memories.\n\nIf you're looking for something brand new to try at university that provides variety, fun and challenges then join us today or come see us at Fresher's Fair!\n\nWe have:\n\nIndoor sessions in George Fox foyer - Tuesday 6-8pm and Thursday 8-10pm\n\nOutdoor sessions all over the place (varying times and locations)\n\nCheck out our youtube channel for a taster of what we get up to: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9gLmkY-RxaqT\\_uN5t5YWQ  or check out our Instagram page @lupatsparkour"

    "description": "Sexpression Lancaster is a branch of the national charity Sexpression UK, a near-peer independent UK charity with the goal of empowering young people to make decisions about relationships and sex. We do this by running informal and comprehensive RSE workshops in local schools, and also by running outreach projects, advocacy campaigns, fundraising events and socials on campus. All of our members have the option to become volunteers for this not for profit organisation and, after receiving full training and a DBS check, are ready to visit schools and other groups in Lancaster and the surrounding areas to faciliate workshops covering a wide range of topics: from contraception and STIs, to healthy relationships and consent, sexual orientation and gender identity, the influence of pornography... and many more! This aspect of the society is not compulsory, however, and we also welcome members who feel that standing in front of a class isn't for them - there's plenty of other things to get involved with! \n\nWe believe that access to useful and inclusive RSE is a right, and are passionate about making this available to young people in our local area. We are looking to recruit members who are also passionate about this issue, to join our team of volunteers and to help us to deliver as many workshops as possible - and to spread the word about Sexpression and all things sexual health - over the coming year! Our members will also have the opportunity to be involved in our socials, on-campus campaigns and fundraising events, as well as national sex education conferences.\n\nFor more information about Sexpression Lancaster and how to get involved, don't hesitate to get in touch in the following ways:\n\n*   Email: lancaster@sexpression.org.uk\n*   Instagram: @lancastersexpression\n*   Twitter: @SexpressionLanc\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you soon! :)"

    "description": "**LANCASTER UNIVERSITY CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY**\n\n**[www.lanunicons.co.uk](http://lanunicons.co.uk)**\n\n**2022-23 Membership Fee:** £5.00 \n\n**About us**\n\nLancaster University Conservative Society, more commonly known as ‘LUCS’, is the most active student political society on the Lancaster campus. Our mission is to promote the values and policies of the Conservative and Unionist Party at Lancaster University. LUCS equally serves as a forum for discussion and debate, as well as a social scene for like-minded students. \n\nOur society activities can be divided into three categories: debate, activism, and socials: \n\n![May be an image of 11 people and people standing](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/244757056_10159274351173476_6439254931678430552_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e3f864&_nc_ohc=AQwl2m5uX-IAX99-5Gz&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=00_AT_omP1erxrRCxQRZTZXNfL0Qfefd2YULDekdfCCVwTTrQ&oe=6340C7E1)\n\n**Debate**\n\nEvery week we host a wide range of exciting and intellectually stimulating debates on a vast array of political issues, both old and new. LUCS takes pride in our broad-church nature, welcoming students of all views from across the political spectrum. We encourage all our members to express their views, giving everyone the chance to articulate their thoughts and ask pertinent questions.​ Our meetings take place every **Wednesday during term time at 6PM in Elizabeth Livingston Lecture Theatre**.\n\nLUCS also seeks to provide wide-ranging opportunities to hear from the leading lights of the political right by welcoming high-profile guest speakers.\n\nFurthermore, we collaborate with other student political societies to organise regular ‘Question Time’ events where we can truly engage in the battle of ideas against the other parties.\n\n**Activism**\n\nLUCS is also a campaigning organisation, and we actively encourage our members to get involved in grassroots activism. We are proud of the values of the Conservative Party, and proud of putting them into practice. We work hard to get Conservative candidates elected by supporting election campaigns across Lancashire and the wider North West England region. In recent years, LUCS has supported Conservative candidates in City Council, County Council, and General Elections.\n\nFor those who have never campaigned before, LUCS organises campaigning and canvassing training, and boasts several experienced campaigners amongst our ranks to help you out on the doorstep.\n\nMoreover, our members have regularly stood in local elections across the country. At the 2022 Local elections, many LUCS members were Conservative Party candidates in wards across the country. Lancaster University falls within its own ward in Lancaster City Council – University and Scotforth Rural – thus it is usually our members who rise to the challenge of contesting this seat.\n\nLUCS also endeavours to connect our members with fellow conservatives across the UK. We arrange trips to Conservative Party events such as the Conservative Party Conference and the Conservative Party Spring Forum, giving our members the very best networking opportunities.\n\nFrequent media opportunities are presented to LUCS members from media outlets from a university to national level, giving them a platform to discuss their views.\n\nNot all our activism is political. LUCS is also committed to supporting charitable causes, at both a local and national level. We organise an annual collection for the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal and support a range of local charities in their community endeavours.\n\n**Socials**\n\nAs well as being a political society, LUCS is also an active social scene, with socials every week organised by our Social Secretary! Our socials are incredibly diverse, so there’s something for everyone.\n\nSome of our social events have included:\n\n*   Lancaster and Fleetwood Constituency Association Patrons’ Dinner \n    \n*   Brexit social\n    \n*   Christmas meal\n    \n*   Cards night\n    \n*   Pub quizzes\n    \n*   Karaoke (‘Tory-oke’!)\n    \n*   Film club\n    \n*   Cross-party football cup\n    \n*   Bar sports evening\n    \n\nWhat’s more, after all of our weekly meetings LUCS heads for a pint at County Bar (RIP Grad Bar). Most weeks, this usually leads to a night out at the Sugarhouse too!\n\n**Join us**\n\nLUCS membership, priced at £5 per academic year, gives you exclusive access to:\n\n*   All LUCS events - weekly meetings, socials, campaigning days, and anything else we organise.\n    \n*   Our social media package - weekly email updates, the LUCS Facebook group and group chat, the LUCS memes page.\n    \n*   Full society voting rights, including the right to stand for the Executive Committee.\n    \n\nIf you're interested in joining LUCS or supporting our work, please click the orange '**JOIN THIS GROUP**' button at the top of the page and request to join our Society!\n\n**Contact**\n\n**Visit our website: [www.lanunicons.co.uk](http://lanunicons.co.uk)**\n\n**Weekly meetings**\n\n*   _When?_ 6PM, every Wednesday during term time\n    \n*   _Where?_ Elizabeth Livingston Lecture Theatre, Bowland North\n    \n\n**You can contact LUCS via e-mail or any of  our social media accounts:​​​​​**\n\n*   E-Mail: lucspublicity@gmail.com\n    \n*   Facebook: www.facebook.com/LanUniCons\n    \n*   Twitter: www.twitter.com/LanUniCons\n    \n*   Instagram: www.instagram.com/LanUniCons\n    \n\n**Alternatively, you can write to us:**\n\nLancaster University Conservative Society\n\nLancaster University Students' Union, Bowland Main\n\nLancaster University\n\nLancashire\n\nLA1 4YT\n\n**Executive Committee**\n\n*   Chairman - Daniel Kirk\n    \n*   Vice Chairman - Harvey Hayes\n    \n*   General Secretary - Odhran Shelton\n    \n*   Treasurer - Ivan Taran\n    \n*   Social Secretary - Tom Berridge\n    \n*   Media and Publicity Secretary - Owen Limerick"

We do something fun every Tuesday night like film and pizza nights, scavenger hunts around campus, bowling and board games - and after the exciting bits we usually go and have a quiet drink in a college bar. During Term time you can generally find us in Welcome Centre Lecture Theatre 1 on Tuesdays 7:30 - 9:30.\n\nWe’re part of a national network ([SSAGO, the Student Sc](https://www.ssago.org/clubs/view/lancaster)[out And Guide Organisation](https://www.ssago.org/clubs/view/lancaster)) of over 40 universities which means we can offer the unique opportunity to travel around and meet with students with similar interests from across the UK at [rallies](https://www.ssago.org/events) (big national camps) held every term and our annual ball, where a range of activities are on offer - including hiking, trampolining, climbing, kayaking, bar crawls, and, of course, a campfire!\n\nWe organise two of our own camps every year too; a weekend Freshers' Camp in November and a whole week Summer Camp in the penultimate week of the year. We also hold an alumni sleepover in a scout hut in Lancaster in Lent term where we meet up with our graduate friends!\n\nFor those who wish to volunteer, we work closely with both Scouting and Guiding in Lancaster so there are numerous opportunities to get involved with local Groups and Units, whether this is on a weekly basis or just for one off events!\n\nMembership currently only costs £6 per term!\n\nWe’re open to everyone, including those who’ve never been involved with Scouts or Guides before, so do come along - we’d love to meet you, and our socials are an excellent way of making new friends and trying out things you wouldn't usually do! And we're all lovely, so if you have any questions at all then just email us (lancasterssago@gmail.com) or find us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LancasterSSAGO/) ![smile](https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce4_6_5/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-smile.gif) \n\n![Image result for facebook logo](https://image.freepik.com/free-icon/facebook-logo_318-49940.jpg)   facebook.com/groups/LancasterSSAGO               ![Image result for email black and white](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVdsNXOfHQflfe2ru-KDnZ9hV2fF7_s9veRVUzH0vvVNTyJN_t)    lancasterssago@gmail.com"

Lancaster Snow is a great club to join if you enjoy skiing or snowboarding, want to try something new or just want to make friends. We offer two types of membership, full membership or social membership, which can be bought all year round.\n\nBeginners \n\nSkiing and snowboarding are fun sports that anyone can try. We will be running beginner lessons at Rossendale ski slope where the price of lessons will be dependent on the number of people who sign up so get as many people involved and try a new sport! \n\nTraining  \n\nIf you can ski/snowboard, we encourage you to try our race training sessions, no previous race experience is needed. Our training sessions take place at Rossendale ski slope where a slalom course will be set up and you will learn how to race through the gates at speed. \n\nRaces \n\nOur race teams compete in many dry slope races throughout the year including Kings, BUDS and Roses. Our ski team finished 3rd in the Kings league 21/22 season and followed it up with another top 10 result last year. Anyone can get involved in dry slope races, we encourage spectators, and it is and enjoyable day for everyone who comes along. \n\nTrips \n\nEach year we organise a ski trip to the Alps with the help of a reputable tour operator. Our trip committee works closely with the company to create an unmissable trip at the best value. Trips are a great way to meet new people and make unforgettable memories in the mountains. The club also organises a trip to Chill Factore once a term. Chill Factore is an indoor ski slope with real snow located in Manchester.  \n\nSocials \n\nLancaster Snow runs a variety of 'snocials' throughout the year, lots of these you will not want to miss! We encourage all our members to come to our socials and get involved. We also organise annual events including a Winter Ball and a Summer BBQ.  \n\nAny questions just get in touch: \n\nFacebook – Lancaster Snow \n\nInstagram – lancaster\\_snow\\_club \n\nE-mail – [lancaster.snow.club@gmail.com](mailto:lancaster.snow.club@gmail.com) \n\nWe hope you join us on the slopes this year!"

Finally, we have a development squad who play intraclub matches to improve abilities, whilst enjoying lacrosse more socially. \n\nOn top of our Wednesday BUCS matches, we compete in the war of the ROSES (Europe’s biggest inter-university varsity sporting event) against the University of York with our 1st team, 2nd team and our Mixed Lacrosse team. We train twice weekly within the Women’s+ club on Thursdays and Sundays to improve our lax skills and fitness, and also have a separate weekly run that is encouraged to maintain stamina. Additionally, we have strong ties to our lacrosse alumni and host a yearly alumni match to invite graduates back to the uni for a fun game of lacrosse. The Women's+ club runs as a sister club to the Lancaster Univesity Men's+ club, with mixed training and socials available for both clubs to attend. \n\nIf you are brand new to the sport - don't worry! We start our training sessions from the beggining so you can build up the perfect foundation to become a lax pro. We will supply you with all the kit and equipment needed, so all you need are some sporty clothing, trainers, and a willingness to learn :))) We have a 2 week free trial until October 22nd 2023 and taster sessions on Saturday 7th October (2-4pm on 3G) and Sunday 8th October (4-6pm on 3G) if you want to come give it a go! \n\n![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/498671/original/IMG_4577.jpeg)\n\n**Women’s+ Second Team 2022/23**\n\n**Mixed Lacrosse:** \n\nIf you're interested in lacrosse but not too sure… we have a mixed lacrosse training session weekly where anyone is welcome to come along and play lax. Our men’s+, women’s+, and purely mixed members learn new skills each week and play tournaments throughout the year (as well as having a cheeky trip to Fylde for food after every mixed training  ).\n\nWe also go to Liverpool to compete in a mixed lacrosse tournament, and play mixed competitively at ROSES’s, so there’s always game opportunity if you want it. Our Mixed club is a less intense way to try lacrosse, and we encourage everyone to come try it out, regardless of ability. If you’re thinking of coming to mixed, bring your friends and flatmates as everyone is welcome, and please feel free to message our Instagram @Lancaster\\_Lax for any questions. \n\n![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/472470/original/IMG_3988.jpeg)\n\n**Mixed Team at the Liverpool Charity Tournament 2022**\n\n**Socials:** \n\nLacrosse isn’t just a sport, it’s a family for you whilst you’re at Lancaster University and beyond your graduation! We host weekly socials which are a fun way to way to bond as a club and integrate with our men’s+ members. These occur on a Wednesday after our matches, with themes being released at the start of term. Previous themes have included Dynamic Duos, Olympics, Charity shop, the Wedding social, and much more…\n\nWhether you love a good drink, or are completely sober, everyone is welcome at our socials and there is never any pressure to consume alcohol. Additionally, we are committed to all our members wellbeing and understand that an evening social isn’t everyone’s idea of fun, so we also host multiple fully sober socials throughout the year too! One example - and a festive favourite - includes our ice skating social which occurs right before the Christmas break.\n\nFinally, we have two formal nights at Christmas and at the end of Summer term to celebrate our successes each season and commemorate our year as a club. These involve everyone dressing up and enjoying a 3 course meal together then heading off to bars and eventually ending the evening in a nightclub. They are often seen as one of the annual highlights as we have an awards ceremony at the meal to celebrate some of our incredibly players on their hard work that season, so they definitely are not something to miss!\n\n                                                                           ![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/472473/original/IMG_5778.jpeg)\n\n                                                                                           **End of Year Club Summer Meal and Awards Night 2022** \n\n**Training Times:**          \n\n**Women's+**\n\n                Thursdays: 17:30 - 19:00,  Astro 2\n\n                Sundays: 16:30 - 18:00,  3G pitch\n\n**Mixed:** \n\n                Saturdays: 12:00-13:00, Grass Pitch\n\n**Membership:**\n\nWe have various memberships available depending on your wants and needs!

We don't run trials, but instead offer taster sessions so that you decide if you are part of the club, not us. We will ensure there is a place for you in our club should you decide to join us.\n\nCurrently, we have 2 teams that compete in BUCS League and Cup matches as well as an expanding development squad enrolled in the Allianz Inner Warrior league. We offer competitive matches at a range of levels to ensure you have the opportunity to play at the level you feel comfortable to.\n\nHowever, being a part of the club is about so much more than just rugby. The club's focus is on offering members great value for their time commitment and as such we have a number of opportunities that include: community volunteering with local schools, mentor systems to help you adapt and settle into both the club and University life as well as a diverse and exciting social offering. As a club we are proud to say that we do not engage in sponsorships with local bars and nightclubs, giving us the freedom to have our social events wherever and whenever we want. This allows us to provide a social offering aimed at all members and the flexibility to host our socials in venues that appeal to both drinkers and non drinkers alike. We have a big emphasis on wellbeing and vary our social events to ensure all members have the best time.  With designated wellbeing and health and safety officers, your welfare is our main priority.\n\nOver the past few years the club has doubled down on efforts to expand and ensure that we are the most inclusive club on campus. This hard work was recognised by both the University and BUCS as the club was voted Lancaster University Club of The Year and shortly after received the unexpected honour of being named BUCS Club of the Year for 2019, given to the best university sports club in the UK. More recently, in 2022, our club won University Team of the Year, our 1XV were Varsity Winners and we reached the BUCS National Trophy Final. Becoming Northern 2A champions in 2023, we are pushing for more and more great achievements in the future.\n\nWe hope you choose to join us and can't wait to welcome you into our family!\n\n![](https://scontent.fman4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/384531588_702912078169762_5364599623278784750_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=yXQKl1EZaXwAX8bRuNP&_nc_ht=scontent.fman4-2.fna&oh=03_AdRKM43hd2-2jqDs7IpYW0Yg4plbLGFp8UEXEvsDEIMDHQ&oe=654C9259)\n\n**TRAINING:**\n\nMonday: BUCS 1st & 2nd Team Training 18:30 - 20:30, 3G\n\nWednesday: 1XV & 2XV Fixtures, Pitches\n\nThursday: Road to Rugby Sessions 20:00 - 22:00, 3G\n\nFriday: Full Club Training 16:30 - 18:30, 3G \n\nSaturday/Sunday: Allianz Inner Warrior Series Fixture (Development Team), Pitches\n\nSunday: Performance Squad Training 19:30 - 21:00, 3G\n\n![](https://scontent.fman4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/384531677_336603435411315_764163043020569986_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=Ja6Ou8U1ii4AX80vH-v&_nc_ht=scontent.fman4-1.fna&oh=03_AdStxRrmqTlzCsN7331XTNjHUlt7OMn1xagQxa0qRXTWiw&oe=654C7CA4)\n\n**FOLLOW US:**\n\nVisit our socials to find out more about our club, taster sessions, and community!\n\nFacebook- [https://facebook.com/luwrufc/](https://facebook.com/luwrufc/)\n\nInstagram- [https://www.instagram.com/luwrufc/](https://www.instagram.com/luwrufc/)\n\nTiktok- [@luwrufc](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRmftPY3/)"

As a result, we are able to support 3 team and a flourishing college system. \n\nAll three sides compete in weekly BUCS fixtures against other universities. All teams also compete in the annual varsity competition, Roses, against York and the games never fail to draw a large crowd. Last year we had a historic roses, with a clean sheet across all three games. \n\nWe are a club for all abilities and in order to cater for that we have a development pathway which starts with our weekly touch rugby 7s. This allows us to provide regular rugby for those who are just starting or are looking to get back into the sport and help to improve development to move up the teams, and there are multiple examples of this. \n\nAs a club we also pride ourselves on having great fun off the field as well as success on it. Joining the club is a great way to meet people, all with a love for the game of rugby and make some great friends as well. We also have wellbeing sessions to help everyone through the more difficult times we all go through at university.

Go and check out [their website](http://lancasterpoolleague.org.uk/) for more info!\n\nNot only do we play 8-ball, but in the past few years we have also seen success in both 9-ball and Snooker competitions!\n\nJoining LU Pool and Snooker is the first step in getting involved in the culture of bar sports. We'll give you all the info you need to get started, and will also run events alongside the college league, including:\n\n*   Practice sessions, where you can get some coaching from some of the top players on campus\n*   Socials, where you can get to know fellow pool players from across the Uni away from the tables\n*   Intra-campus individuals competitions\n*   Opportunities to represent the Uni across the country!\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Combat works on a hit point system so the outcome of a battle is never predetermined, leading to challenging and rewarding combat!\n\nWe also have opportunites for authentic 12th Century portrayals of church life and religion.\n\nThere is something for everybody in LULHS!\n\nWe hold craft sessions on Thursday evenings 7pm-10pm in Bowland North, usually in SR 23.\n\nWe train every Sunday (provided the weather is good) at Quernmore Park in Lancaster 11am-4pm, and every Wednesday in the Brandrigg Room on campus 1pm-6pm (the location may vary depending on the weather). If you fancy training with us we meet up before each session at Alexandra Square, (the big stairs near Greggs, you can't miss us) before walking or catching the bus to training, make sure you check our Facebook page for details.\n\nIf you want to know more feel free to contact us via our Facebook page:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/LULHS/](http://www.facebook.com/LULHS/)\n\nYou can also find us on other social media:\n\nInstagram: @lulivinghistorysociety\n\nTwitter: LULivHisSoc"

We are a friendly and relaxed club in which all are welcome, no prior experience is necessary and all equipment is provided. Wednesday shoots meet outside Aldi in town at 13.15 pm or Bowland Avenue at 13:30 pm, and Saturday/Sunday shoot details TBC.\n\nAs mentioned, we are a relaxed club so it is not mandatory nor expected of you to attend each session!\n\nTo book onto a session just send the club a Facebook or Instagram message.\n\nAll new shooters (with us) are required to take a taster shoot costing £35 (includes transport, tuition, 25 clays and 25 cartridges). After completing a taster shoot you will be invited to purchase an annual society membership for £35 after which the rates for shooting will be significantly cheaper. Students currently in possession of a shotgun certificate are not required to complete a taster shoot and are able to shoot with their own cartridges if desired. A £10 deposit is required before each session and is refundable from the session cost.  \n\nTaster shoots can become booked up very quickly due to limited spaces so you may have to be booking up to 5 weeks in advance.\n\nWe shoot in several competitions across the country, including BUCS, throughout the year as well as hosting our own invitational competition, the Lancaster Cup, each year. Please see our Facebook and Instagram for more details and photos.\n\nWe shoot in all weathers so recommend members to dress appropriately similarly, please wear firm footware and bring a coat/gilet/fleece with deep and strong pockets to hold cartridges. \n\nIt is our intention hold an informational talk at the beginning of the year but details TBC.\n\nFacebook: [www.facebook.com/LUCPSC](https://www.facebook.com/LUCPSC/)\n\nInstagram: [@lushooting](https://www.instagram.com/lushooting/)\n\nPresident Contact Details: Luke Misra l.misra@lancaster.ac.uk\n\n![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/373533/original/Page_Pic_1.jpg)![](https://assets.prod.unioncloud-internal.com/image/images/373536/original/Page_Pic_2.jpg)"

So come along and get to know fellow squash players - everyone is invited!\n\n**Competitive Players**\n\n**The BUCS Squad**\n\nFor those who wish to play squash competitively, we operate three teams within the BUCS (British Universities & Colleges Sport) leagues, where you can proudly represent Lancaster University Squash Club and battle it out against other universities across the North-West. With 2 Men's teams and 1 Women's team playing on Wednesday afternoons, there is plenty of space for all those interested in attending try-outs at the beginning of the year. The BUCS Squad is made up of 18 people (6 individuals for each 5-person team). Training occurs on Sunday and Monday evenings every week, coached by Josh Taylor (Ex-England Squash Coach, currently coaches Patrick Rooney #WR20 and works for the Professional Squash Association). The Men's 1st team play in Division 1A Northern, the Men's 2nd in Division 2A Northern and the Women's 1st in Division 2A Northern. \n\n**Regional Leagues**\n\nWe have two teams competing in the North-West Counties Squash League ([https://www.nwcsl.org/](https://www.nwcsl.org/))! Playing on Thursday evenings, alternating between home and away games, individuals in the Regional Leagues teams have the opportunity to gain further match experience, test themselves out against different styles of squash, and enjoy time on the road with their fellow teammates! \n\nThe 1st team plays in Divsion 3 Central, and the 2nd team plays in Division 4 Central North.\n\n**Roses**\n\nOnce a year, Lancaster University faces off against its biggest rival - York University. Taking place in Summer Term, teams from across the two universities compete in **Roses**, the biggest inter-university tournament in Europe. In 2022, we smashed York, and are looking to do it again in 2023!\n\n**Men's and Women's Development Squad**\n\nFor keen squash players of all abilities or just for people who are interested in getting into the sport, we run **The** **Development Squad**. There are three Men's and one Women's squad. Training once a week (different times for each squad), led by members of the Club Executive Committee, the Development Squad offers the opportunity to improve your game, play people of your skill level, and get involved with frequent competitions! It is also an excellent way for players to challenge for BUCS Squad positions in the future, or to earn an invitation to train with the teams if appropriate.\n\n**Membership Prices.**\n\n**BUCS member**: £80\n\n**College Squash Membership**: £55\n\n**Development Squad member** (1 year): £40 \n\n**Development Squad member** (1 term): £20\n\nNOTE: for information about gym memberships, from prices to what's included, see the Lancaster University Sports Centre website [here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sport/sports-centre/membership/).\n\n**Social Media**\n\nPlease don't hesitate to follow us or get in contact with us!\n\nYou can find us on:\n\nFacebook as Lancaster University Squash Club ([https://www.facebook.com/lusquash/](https://www.facebook.com/LUSQUASH/)) \n\nOn our new website [https://lusquash.com/](https://lusquash.com/) \n\nFollow us on Instagram at [@lusquash](https://www.instagram.com/lusquash/)\n\nOr email us at [lancasteruniversitysquashclub@gmail.com](mailto:lancasteruniversitysquashclub@gmail.com)."

We provide our members with professional development and soft skill workshops, speaker events, networking opportunities, educational resources and a social space to connect with like-minded students. \n\nOur aim is to equip our members with the personal and professional skills they need to make meaningful, informed career choices and get the most out of their time at university. By creating a space for these students to share their experiences, concerns, questions and resources, The 93% Club aims to ensure that all students, regardless of their educational background, have the same positive academic and social experiences.\n\nAt Lancaster University, we hope to run insightful events in a variety of sectors, as well as exclusive coaching opportunities, and various networking events with Alumni and Recruiters.\n\nSign-up now!\n\nTo find out more, please visit www.93percent.club/"

    "description": "Here's some food for thought: why not join a society that'll get you brownie points with your flatmates? We bake a range of sweet and savoury treats, try out new cafes around Lancaster, watch GBBO together and have lots of relaxed socials!\n\nMembership for each term will cost £3, however, if you buy an annual membership for the whole year it is only £6. It then costs just £2.50 for every bake that you sign up for, although special events and workshops may cost slightly more. Baking sign up will be launched on Saturday afternoon and is accessed through the Student's Union website. So just bring yourself and a container along on a Saturday to Fylde Common Room - we supply the recipe, equipment and ingredients. \n\nNo matter your level of baking skills come and give us a go! \n\nLike our Facebook (Lancaster University Baking Society) and/or Instagram page (@lubakingsociety) to keep up to date on upcoming bakes and socials and we hope to see you there :)"

    "description": "Welcome to LUSS, Lancaster University's caving club!\n\nThe society has existed since 1967 and was once the most prestigious in the UK with many caving credits to its name. Until the 1980s, LUSS was very active in original explorations in the Yorkshire Dales, the eastern Picos of Spain (where they explored Sima 56 to a depth of 1169 m), Venezuela, and other locations. It also did some valuable scientific work. Its alumni include Colin Boothroyd, Dave Checkley, John Gardner, and Mel Gascoyne, and in its earlier years it was mentored by Dick Glover.\n\nDuring its active period it produced four very fine journals which are now difficult to get hold of. It is worth noting that good quality images of the Yorkshire surveys published by LUSS, including those published with the journals, are available on the [Cavemapper](http://cavemaps.org/luss.htm) website.\n\nWe are on the lookout for more experienced and inexperienced members!\n\nIn addition to caving, we run socials throughout the year ranging from bouldering to ice skating in the winter.\n\nIf you are interested in joining us, please come along to our beginner sessions! If these suit you, we will be running abseiling and SRT practice sessions at regular intervals throughout the year.\n\nFind us on Facebook: [Lancaster University Speleological Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1933676873324193/)\n\nFind us on Instagram: [@luss\\_caving](https://www.instagram.com/luss_caving/?hl=en-gb)\n\nEmail us: [speleological.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk](mailto:hiking.su@groups.lancaster.ac.uk)"

There are a variety of dances and at LUSwing, we mostly focus on Lindy Hop, an improvised partner dance which originated in the Black community of late 1920s Harlem, New York.\n\nInclusivity, acceptance and mutual respect are at the very core of Swing Dance. It is vital that we recognise the cultural context of Swing and acknowledge its black creators so that we may sustain the values of those to whom we owe so much and continue to promote a diverse, multicultural community welcome to all.\n\nAs part of the society, you’ll be exposed to the culture and music of the swing era with live bands, social dance events and even weekend excursions in other scenes across the country! The swing dance community is a world-wide community that is incredibly friendly and welcoming."

    "description": "Lancaster University Running and Athletics Club aim to promote running both as a competitive sport and a healthy, sociable, recreational hobby. We are open to all abilities, whether you’ve never run, thrown or jumped a day in your life or you’re competing at the highest level - there is something for everyone! We believe that although it is important to push yourself to the best you can be and to have a support of other like-minded athletes around, it is also hugely important to be an open and accessible club, which is why we welcome people of all abilities.\n\nOur training captains also provide specialised training schedules based on people's abilities, so whether you’re just looking to run your first 5K or training for your third marathon, we can help you out. We also organise a Couch to 5K group who work separately to our main group to achieve their personal goals.\n\nAs a club, we encourage everyone to take part in races, though this is not compulsory. As you all know, it's not about winning - it's the taking part that matters. We compete in many local road races, the Mid-Lancs Cross Country League, Steel Cup, the BUCS Cross Country races, the BUCS Track and Field events and some larger national races. The race distances vary a lot, from 60m to 800m, then all the way up to a Full Marathon, meaning there is something for everyone!  \n  \nSocial events are held every other week throughout term time and all members are encouraged to attend. This is the best time to meet like-minded people and catch up with fellow club members. Our socials are well known throughout the University for being incredibly entertaining and enjoyable and we can promise you will have some great memories by the end of the year!\n\n**When do we meet?**\n\nWe meet at 6pm on Mondays in the Pendle TV room (above Pendle Bar) for a variety of runs, such as 10k, 5k, Couch-to-5k and interval sessions, as well as at 3pm on Wednesdays for a track session at Salt Ayre Leisure Centre. We also meet at 4pm on Sundays for circuit training in County South Lecture Theatre (during winter) or on the rugby pitches by Health Innovation campus (in summer). \n\nWe look forward to meeting you all at our training sessions! Feel free to get in contact in the meantime if you have any questions.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lancasteruniversityRAC/"
